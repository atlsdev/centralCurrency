# Atlas Dev - Central Currency
This is a project currently In Development.
It's meant to be a Universal Currency for use in all of Atlas Dev's projects, such as Discord bots with a Point System, or something like that.  
  
I would like to have all the balances synced, but I gotta figure out how to sync users up, until then, this project is on hold.
